Web demo packing

Context
	FuckJS - has to be released
	Part of toolchain
		Preprocessor (opt.py, cool tricks with closure?)
		Everything automated - no manual minification

Common packing techniques
	Minify
	PNG hack

The shader problem
	Strings in JS - won't minify
	Use another minifier! (glsl-unit, ctrl+alt+test), packs all but uniforms/attributes
	Can we do better? (screenshot crteck or fade)
	Merging all shaders into one (cat everything, multiple main_xx() functions)
	Patching the minifier (dead code problem, output minified entry point names)
	Final result (shaders.js)

Pushing it
	Some symbols still not minified (demo.min.js)
	Compressing the names at runtime (regex, cannot use big hash eg 32bits)
	Search and replace (quick and dirty ad hoc sed)

Other things we tried
	Minifying very frequent symbols (e.g function, var, this)
		did not really work, huffman was already doing it optimally
	Using libs (glMatrix) - it works - just make sure you remove the (function(){})() enclosing everything that prevents minification
	Preprocessing using closure's static analysis (-> evO's slides)

Size matters

Questions?
