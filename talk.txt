Collision of two worlds: console versus web

In the last years, we've seen the web becoming more and more of a gaming platform, to the point where we can now run real games in the browser. At the same time, the traditional game industry have been striving to get console games more connected, social, and overall, to bring consoles closer to the web world.

However, while these two industries are somehow converging, they still have dramatically different history, values, processes and philosophy. This talk will put console and web development in perspective, compare their inner workings, and humbly try to extract what each side could learn from the other.

  started as niche
