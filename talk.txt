Collision of two worlds: console versus web

In the last years, we've seen the web becoming more and more of a gaming platform, to the point where we can now run real games in the browser. At the same time, the traditional game industry have been striving to get console games more connected, social, and overall, to bring consoles closer to the web world.

However, while these two industries are somehow converging, they still have dramatically different history, values, processes and philosophy. This talk will put console and web development in perspective, compare their inner workings, and humbly try to extract what each side could learn from the other.

You said collision?
  Consoles going online
    Not only multiplayer gameplay
    Leaderboards, achievements (e.g XBLA)
    Analytics
    SOCIAL
  Web -> gaming

Same, but...

web legacy
  open source (-> internet)
  continuous updates, deployment, testing
  release model encourages accessibility and ergonomy
  developer-centric

console legacy
  everything closed (e.g $20000 devkit), closed source everywhere
  one-shot release (disc)
  production-centric

Today / Content creation pipelines
IMPROVEMENTS!!!

console games
  in-house engines + tools
  off-the-shelf engine!

web games
